*) From Instruction:
    -> https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from
    -> FROM [--platform=<platform>] <image> [AS <name>]
    -> FROM [--platform=<platform>] <image>[:<tag>] [AS <name>]
    -> FROM [--platform=<platform>] <image>[@<digest>] [AS <name>]
    -> The 'FROM' instruction initializes a new build stage and sets the Base Imageopen_in_new for subsequent instructions. As such, a valid 'Dockerfile' must start with a 'FROM' instruction. The image can be any valid image – it is especially easy to start by pulling an image from the Public Repositories
        -> 'ARG' is the only instruction that may precede FROM in the Dockerfile. See
        -> 'FROM' can appear multiple times within a single Dockerfile to create multiple images or use one build stage as a dependency for another. Simply make a note of the last image ID output by the commit before each new 'FROM' instruction. Each 'FROM' instruction clears any state created by previous instructions.
        -> Optionally a name can be given to a new build stage by adding 'AS name' to the 'FROM' instruction. The name can be used in subsequent 'FROM' and 'COPY --from=<name>' instructions to refer to the image built in this stage.
        -> The 'tag' or 'digest' values are optional. If you omit either of them, the builder assumes a 'latest' tag by default. The builder returns an error if it cannot find the 'tag' value.
        -> The optional '--platform' flag can be used to specify the platform of the image in case FROM references a multi-platform image. For example, 'linux/amd64', 'linux/arm64', or 'windows/amd64'. By default, the target platform of the build request is used. Global build arguments can be used in the value of this flag, for example automatic platform ARGs allow you to force a stage to native build platform (--platform=$BUILDPLATFORM), and use it to cross-compile to the target platform inside the stage.
